# About Chair flight

---

Our goal is to build an **Open Source**, **Free** and **Community driven**
aviation question bank built by students for students.

---

### What is the current state of the project?

The project is still in early development. Most features and functionalities are
not yet developed and in general things are expected **Not** to work.

---

### What is the source of your questions?

Chair flight uses the **Chair Flight Question Bank**. This bank is built by
students for students based on feedback collected in the exams. Unlike other
banks we intend to keep this part of the project fully public and available for
everyone to use, audit, and contribute.

---

### How will you make money of this?

We probably won't. Although not formalized you can think of this project and our
team as a "non-profit".

We will most likely develop a "premium" version on top of the free content, and
we may use adds for non-paying users, but access to the question bank will
remain free for as long as this project is still going.

---

### How can I contribute?

At the moment we are keeping a small team involved in this project to avoid
growing faster than we can handle. We want to make sure the core of our product
works in a robust way before finding ourselves stuck with too much content to
migrate

In the future we hope to provide you with all the tools you could possible want
to help us make this project even better
